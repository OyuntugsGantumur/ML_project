# Introduction
(OYU)
- Introduction to our project, project goals and planning


# Data Gathering
(SHAKH)
- Usage of Kaggle dataset
- image of the kaggle dataset interaction and display



# Model Structure
(SHAKH)
## Base Model
- Usage of existing code and its results/accuracy


## Modifications
- Our modificaions (batch normalization + maxpooling2d)
- Runtime issues and other errors, trial and error process



# Facial Recognition
(OYU)
- Computer Vision library
- challenges
- our work-around


# Model Running
(OYU)
- showing model running image
- our usage of custom hand-picked images
- the results and accuracy of our model on those images


# Conclusion
(SHAKH)
- Some type of conclusion and future directions
- Ways to "improve" or change approach (handling side-face images in training)



# Run Notebook in Google Colab

Click the link below to run [our notebook](https://github.com/pard187/pard187.github.io/blob/master/Final_Project_Gormley_Giffin_Johnston_Saleh.ipynb) directly in Google Collab. No coding is required to run this notebook, you just need to run every code cell in order or simply click Runtime -> Run all and wait for all cells to run.

*Please note that since the US-Accident dataset we are using is too big, it was not convienient to download and import it to Google Drive or Github. Therefore, our notebook is pulling the data directly from Kaggle. A potential drawback to this method is that any changes to the dataset on Kaggle will affect the ability of the analysis in this notebook to be replicated. At the time of analysis, the US-Accidents dataset was last updated July 9, 2020. Were the dataset to be altered at a later date, then the conclusions drawn as a part of this analysis might change. We have however, stored a version of the US Accidents data in this GitHub repository for access at a later date.*
